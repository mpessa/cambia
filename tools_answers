1. One of the most helpful things about version control systems is the ability to go back and see how developers were able to move through a problem. Another great thing is the ability to create multiple branches that allow for divergent but concurrent work while not stepping on another developer's toes. What I mean by this is that two developers can work within the same file without causing issues with each others work. This leads into one downside: Merge conflicts. While it's understandable that they occur, the existence doesn't always match up with reality due to small issues like line number changes or whitespace changes.

2. Docker is great for developing because it allows for developers to create minimal but complete virtual machines. This allows us to see how the system will behave while deployed because the finished code will be deployed in the exact same environment. This assists developing and testing because we know that the environment will not change and any behavior that we create or modify will behave exactly the same in production. Docker also helps simplify the deploy process by creating images that can be spun up extremely quickly. This is especially helpful when dealing with microservices or essential services that cannot be brought down.

3. I chose to use Python for this exercise. The reason for it was that it's a great language for prototyping or creating small programs.
